🌐 Code Translator: Multi-Language Code Conversion Tool
=======================================================

🚧 Project Status: Work in Progress 🚧
--------------------------------------

### 📝 Overview

Code Translator is an experimental Python-based tool designed to convert source code between different programming languages. The project aims to provide an automated solution for code translation, with a focus on maintaining original logic and functionality.

### 🔬 Current State

IMPORTANT: This project is in an early development stage and has known limitations:

-   Translation accuracy is not guaranteed
-   Not all language conversions will be perfect
-   Requires significant manual review and correction

### ✨ Features

-   Supports multiple programming languages
-   Attempts to preserve original code logic
-   Provides basic translation between common languages
-   Modular design for future expansions

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

-   Inconsistent translation quality
-   Potential syntax and structural errors
-   Limited support for complex programming constructs
-   Requires manual verification and correction

🗺️ Roadmap

-   Improve translation accuracy
-   Add more language support
-   Implement advanced parsing techniques
-   Create comprehensive test suite
-   Develop web interface
